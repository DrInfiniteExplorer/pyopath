# PyOPath

Other similar but different things:

* xpath - for xml documents
* jsonpath - for json documents
* objectpath - for list-dict documents

# What is this then?
It can do the stuff above, but it can also query structures of objects in the application space itself, not just data documents. yay!

Or well, it will be able to, once it's up and running properly. Currently I'm working on just making an xpath AST.
